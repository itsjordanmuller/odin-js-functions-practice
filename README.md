# Odin JS Functions & Practice

This repository, titled "Odin JS Functions & Practice", represents my efforts to grasp the fundamental concepts of JavaScript, specifically focusing on functions. As a self-motivated learner, I took on the challenge of understanding and implementing various types of functions as outlined in The Odin Project's curriculum.

This repository is part of a series dedicated to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. I used the Odin Project as a way to practice various concepts of development and programming. The Odin Project is actually why I started using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) & [GitHub](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller) in the first place!
